## Research Interests

I study **security and privacy in AI systems**, including large language models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents.  
My current work focuses on vulnerabilities in agent pipelines, missing security properties, and risks of **persuasion or persona manipulation**. I have also conducted research on **fairness and bias similarity in LLMs** and on **federated learning** with emphasis on robustness, privacy, and unlearning. More broadly, I am interested in **trustworthy and responsible AI** and in developing **privacy-preserving methods** for collaborative and agent-based learning.
