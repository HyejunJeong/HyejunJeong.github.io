## About
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, advised by [Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/) and co-advised by [Eugene Bagdasarian](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~eugene/). 

My research centers on **trustworthy and responsible AI, AI agent security, and AI safety**. I study **AI agent vulnerabilities, LLM fairness, adversarial robustness, and unlearning**. I also mentor undergraduates and support teaching in computer and network security.

My goal is to <em>identify security and privacy risks in AI systems and design defenses</em> that make them robust, transparent, and safe to trust—just as early internet security shaped the web, today we must do the same for AI.
